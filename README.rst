Teleme
======
Teleme(pronounced `tell-me`)  is an async, super simple Telegram Bot framework.

Under Development
-----------------
Whilst the code has been used for years privately, since I just released the code,
there may have been some bugs that have left undiscovered. I have decided to set
the status of this project as Beta.
